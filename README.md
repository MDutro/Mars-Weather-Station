
## Mars Weather Station

This is a simple app written in React that works with NASA's API for its InSight weather station at Elysium Planitia on Mars aimed at elementary age children.

The app loads and displays weather data for a week on Mars. Please note that the data displayed will be a few days behind the current date on Earth. I have included a button to convert temperatures from degrees Celsius to degrees Farenheit and toggle back to Celsius again.

Additionally, the user can enter his/her zip code and see the current temperature conditions where he/she lives or in any place that uses the zip code system. Conversion from Celcius to Farenheit is also implemented for the user's local conditions.

Images from NASA's Mars rover APIs and facts about the planet are planned features as well. 

The final version of the app will include a kid friendly, science fiction-style theme and UI elements.
