## Mars Weather Station

This is a simple app that works with NASA's API for its InSight weather station at Elysium Planitia on Mars aimed at elementary age children.

The app is very bare bones at this point. The app will load and display weather data from the past eight (8) days on Mars. I have included a button to convert temperatures from degrees Celsius to degrees Farenheit and toggle back to Celsius again.

The next stage will be to incorporate a basic form for the user to enter his/her location and fetch current weather data for comparison. 

Images from NASA's Mars rover APIs and facts about the planet are planned features as well. 

The final version of the app will include a kid friendly, science fiction-style theme and UI elements.
